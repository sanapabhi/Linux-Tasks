Question:

The system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries has streamlined access management by implementing group-based access control. Here's what you need to do:


a. Create a group named nautilus_developers across all App servers within the Stratos Datacenter.
b. Add the user stark into the nautilus_developers group on all App servers. If the user doesn't exist, create it as well.

Answer:

Understanding the Task
Create a group named nautilus_developers on all App servers.
Add user stark to this group on all App servers. If stark doesn't exist, create it.


Assumptions
You have SSH access to all App servers.
You have the necessary permissions to create users and groups.


Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Access Each App Server
Establish an SSH connection to each App server in the Stratos Datacenter.

Step 2: Create the Group
On each App server, create the group nautilus_developers using the groupadd command:

#sudo groupadd nautilus_developers

Step 3: Create or Add User to Group
On each App server, check if user stark exists:

#id stark &> /dev/null


##If the command returns an error (exit code 1), the user doesn't exist.
If the command is silent, the user exists.##

If the user doesn't exist, create it:


#sudo useradd stark


Add the user stark to the nautilus_developers group:

#sudo usermod -aG nautilus_developers stark


Example
Assuming you have three App servers named appserver1, appserver2, and appserver3, here's how you would execute the commands on each server:

ON APPSERVER1:


ssh user@appserver1
sudo su -
groupadd nautilus_developers
id stark &> /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
  useradd stark
fi
usermod -aG nautilus_developers stark


ON APPSERVER2:


ssh user@appserver2
sudo su -
groupadd nautilus_developers
id stark &> /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
  useradd stark
fi
usermod -aG nautilus_developers stark


ON APPSERVER3:


ssh user@appserver3
sudo su -
groupadd nautilus_developers
id stark &> /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
  useradd stark
fi
usermod -aG nautilus_developers stark


EXPLANATION

ssh user@appserverX: Connects to the specified App server.
sudo su -: Switches to root or equivalent user.
groupadd nautilus_developers: Creates the group nautilus_developers.
id stark &> /dev/null: Checks if user stark exists.
if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then useradd stark; fi: Creates user stark if it doesn't exist.
usermod -aG nautilus_developers stark: Adds stark to the nautilus_developers group.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

Efficiency: For a large number of servers, consider using scripting or configuration management tools to automate the process.
Security: Set appropriate permissions for the group and its members.
Password Policy: Enforce strong password policies for the created user.
Home Directory: Create the home directory for the user if necessary.
