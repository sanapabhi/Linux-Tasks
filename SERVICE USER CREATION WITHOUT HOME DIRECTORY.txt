
QUESTION:
In response to the latest tool implementation at xFusionCorp Industries, the system admins require the creation of a service user account. 
Here are the specifics:
Create a user named anita in App Server 3 without a home directory.

ANSWER:
UNDERSTANDING THE TASK:
Create a user named anita on App Server 3.
The user should not have a home directory.

ASSUMPTIONS:
You have SSH access to App Server 3.
You have root or sudo privileges on App Server 3.
The underlying operating system is Linux (most common for servers).

Command:

#useradd -M anita

EXPLANATION:

useradd: This command is used to create a new user account.
-M: This option specifies that no home directory should be created for the user.
anita: This is the name of the user to be created.

EXAMPLE:

SSH into App Server 3 as a user with sudo privileges or directly as root.
Execute the command:

#sudo useradd -M anita

Replace sudo with su - if you're logged in as a regular user and want to switch to root.

VERIFICATION:

To verify that the user has been created without a home directory, you can check the /etc/passwd file:

#cat /etc/passwd | grep anita

This should output a line similar to:

anita:x:1001:1001::/dev/null:/bin/false

Note the /dev/null in the home directory field, indicating no home directory.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:

Password: You might need to set a password for the user using the passwd command.
Group Membership: If the user needs to belong to specific groups, use the -G option with the useradd command.
Shell: To specify a different shell for the user, use the -s option with the useradd command.
Security: Consider the security implications of creating a user without a home directory. Ensure that the user has appropriate permissions and access controls.
