QUESTION:
A Nautilus developer has stored confidential data on the jump host within Stratos DC. 
To ensure security and compliance, this data must be transferred to one of the app servers. 
Given developers lack direct access to these servers, the system admin team has been enlisted for assistance.

Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 3 placing it in the directory /home/webapp.

ANSWER:

Understanding the Problem:

Sensitive data is stored on a jump host, which is a security risk.
Data needs to be moved to a more secure app server.
Developers lack direct access to app servers.

Solution:

Use the scp command to securely copy the file from the jump host to the app server. As developers lack direct access, the system admin team will execute this command.

#scp user@jump_host:/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg user@app_server_3:/home/webapp/

EXPLANATION OF THE COMMAND:

>scp: Secure copy command for transferring files securely over SSH.
>user@jump_host: Username and hostname of the jump server. Replace user with the actual username and jump_host with the hostname or IP address.
>/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg: Path to the file on the jump server.
>user@app_server_3: Username and hostname of the app server. Replace user with the actual username and app_server_3 with the hostname or IP address.
>/home/webapp/: Destination directory on the app server.

EXAMPLE:

ASSUMING THE FOLLOWING:

Username on both servers: admin
Jump server hostname: jump1.stratosdc.com
App server hostname: app3.stratosdc.com

The command would be:

#scp admin@jump1.stratosdc.com:/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg admin@app3.stratosdc.com:/home/webapp/

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:

Authentication: The command requires SSH keys or password authentication to access both servers. Ensure proper authentication is configured.
Permissions: Verify that the user on the app server has write permissions to the /home/webapp directory.
Security: The scp command encrypts data during transfer, but consider additional security measures like file permissions and access controls on the app server.
Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to notify the system admin or developer in case of failures.
Confirmation: Once the file is copied successfully, verify its existence and integrity on the app server.

BEST PRACTICES:

Regularly review and update SSH keys.
Use strong passwords or SSH keys for authentication.
Implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive data.
Monitor system logs for any suspicious activity.
