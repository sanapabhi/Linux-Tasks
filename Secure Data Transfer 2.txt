QUESTION:
A Nautilus developer has stored confidential data on the jump host within Stratos DC. 
To ensure security and compliance, this data must be transferred to one of the app servers. 
Given developers lack direct access to these servers, the system admin team has been enlisted for assistance.

Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 1 placing it in the directory /home/nfsshare.

ANSWER:

Understanding the Task

Copy a file named nautilus.txt.gpg from a jump server to App Server 1.
Place the copied file in the /home/nfsshare directory on App Server 1.

ASSUMPTIONS

You have SSH access to both the jump server and App Server 1 with appropriate permissions.
The jump server and App Server 1 are within the same network or accessible via SSH.
Necessary security measures are in place for handling confidential data

SOLUTION

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

->Log in to the jump server: Establish an SSH connection to the jump server using your credentials.
->Copy the file: Use the scp command to securely copy the file from the jump server to App Server 1.
->Verify the copy: Check if the file has been copied correctly to the target location.

Commands:
> Replace 'your_username', 'jump_server_ip', 'app_server_ip' with actual values
> On the jump server:
#scp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg your_username@app_server_ip:/home/nfsshare

EXPLANATION
>scp: Secure copy command for transferring files.
>/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg: Source file location on the jump server.
>your_username@app_server_ip: Destination user and IP address of App Server 1.
>/home/nfsshare: Target directory on App Server 1.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

Security: Ensure the SSH connection is secure by using strong authentication methods and encryption.
Permissions: Verify that the user on App Server 1 has appropriate permissions to write to the /home/nfsshare directory.
File Integrity: Consider using checksums (e.g., MD5, SHA256) to verify the file integrity after the transfer.
Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to address potential issues during the copy process.

EXAMPLE:

#scp myuser@jump_server_192.168.1.10:/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg myuser@app_server_192.168.1.20:/home/nfsshare
