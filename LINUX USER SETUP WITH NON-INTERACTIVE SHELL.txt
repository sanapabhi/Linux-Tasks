Question:
To accommodate the backup agent tool's specifications, 
the system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries requires the creation of a user with a non-interactive shell. 
Here's your task:

ANSWER:
Understanding the Task - 
We need to create a user named ravi on App Server 2 with a non-interactive shell. 
This means the user will not be able to log in interactively, but can still be used by system services or scripts.

STEPS INVOLVED

Log in to App Server 2 as a user with sudo privileges. This is typically the root user or a user in the sudo group.
Create the user using the adduser command. The -s option specifies the shell.
Verify the user creation using the id command.

COMMANDS AND EXAMPLE

# Log in to App Server 2 as root or a sudo user
ssh root@appserver2

# Create the user ravi with a non-interactive shell
sudo adduser ravi -s /sbin/nologin

# Verify the user creation
sudo id ravi

EXPLANATION OF COMMANDS

1.ssh root@appserver2: This command establishes a secure shell connection to App Server 2 as the root user. 
Replace root with your username if you're using a different user.

2.sudo adduser ravi -s /sbin/nologin:
sudo: Executes the command with superuser privileges.
adduser ravi: Creates a new user named ravi.
-s /sbin/nologin: Sets the shell for the user to /sbin/nologin, which prevents interactive logins.

3.sudo id ravi: Displays user and group information for the user ravi. 
This command can be used to verify if the user was created successfully and if the shell is set correctly.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

1.Password: The adduser command will prompt you for a password for the user. This is optional for non-interactive users but recommended for security purposes.
2.Home Directory: The default home directory for the user will be created in /home/ravi. You can specify a different location using the -d option in the adduser command.
3.Group Membership: You can add the user to groups using the -G option in the adduser command. For example, sudo adduser ravi -G backup_agents.
4.Security: Ensure that the user has only the necessary permissions to perform its tasks. Avoid granting unnecessary privileges.
