QUESTION:

Due to an accidental data mix-up, user data was unintentionally mingled on Nautilus App Server 1 at the /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. 
To rectify this, specific user data needs to be filtered and relocated. Here are the details:

Locate all files (excluding directories) owned by user rose within the /home/usersdata directory on App Server 1. 
Copy these files while preserving the directory structure to the /official directory.

ANSWER:

UNDERSTANDING THE TASK:

We need to find all regular files owned by user 'rose' within the '/home/usersdata' directory on App Server 1.
These files need to be copied to the '/official' directory while maintaining their original directory structure.

SOLUTION:

We can achieve this using a combination of find and cp commands.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
COMMAND:

#ssh user@appserver1
#sudo su - .....................................# Switch to root user (or use sudo for specific commands)
#cd /home/usersdata ............................# Navigate to the source directory
#find . -user rose -type f -exec cp --parents {} /official \;

OR

#ssh user@appserver1
#sudo find /home/usersdata -user rose -type f -exec cp --parents {} /official \;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

EXPLANATION:

find /home/usersdata: Starts searching from the '/home/usersdata' directory.
-user rose: Specifies that we're looking for files owned by user 'rose'.
-type f: Limits the search to regular files (excluding directories).
-exec cp --parents {} /official \;: For each found file:
--parents: Preserves the directory structure during the copy operation.
{}: Represents the current file found by find.
/official: Specifies the destination directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:

1.Permissions: Ensure the target directory ('/official') exists and has appropriate permissions for the copy operation.
2.Large Datasets: For large datasets, consider using rsync for efficiency and additional features.
3.Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues during the copy process.
4.Verification: After the operation, verify that the files have been copied correctly and the original data remains intact.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECURITY NOTE:

Exercise caution when running commands with sudo or as the root user. Incorrect usage can have serious consequences.
Consider using more restrictive permissions for the find command if applicable to enhance security.

{{{IF: No files were copied or some of them are missing! on App Server 1}}}

TROUBLESHOOTING THE COPY ISSUE

Understanding the Problem:
No files were copied or some files are missing from App Server 1 to the '/official' directory.


1.Permissions:

The user running the command might not have sufficient permissions to access or modify the source or destination directories.
The destination directory might not have the correct permissions to allow file creation.

2.File System Issues:

Disk space might be full on the target server.
File system errors or corruption might prevent file creation.

3.Command Execution Errors:

Syntax errors in the command might prevent it from working correctly.
Issues with the find or cp commands could cause failures.

4.Network Issues:

IF COPYING FILES ACROSS A NETWORK, NETWORK CONNECTIVITY OR PERFORMANCE ISSUES MIGHT INTERFERE.


@TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1.CHECK PERMISSIONS:

Verify that the user running the command has read permissions on the source directory ('/home/usersdata') and write permissions on the destination directory ('/official').
Use ls -ld /home/usersdata and ls -ld /official to check permissions.
If necessary, adjust permissions using chmod or chown.

#ls -ld /home/usersdata
#ls -ld /beta

#chomod 777 /home/usersdata
#chmod 777 /official

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2.CHECK DISK SPACE:

Ensure there is sufficient disk space on the target server ('/official' directory).
Use df -h to check disk usage.

#df -h /beta

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

3.VERIFY COMMAND SYNTAX:

Double-check the command for any typos or errors.
Test the command on a small subset of files to isolate the issue.

#touch /beta/testfile

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

4.CHECK FOR FILE SYSTEM ISSUES:

Run file system checks like fsck to identify and repair any errors.

#fsck /dev/sda1  # Replace /dev/sda1 with the correct device

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

5.TEST NETWORK CONNECTIVITY:

If copying files over a network, verify network connectivity and performance.

6.USE RSYNC FOR ROBUSTNESS:

Consider using rsync for its features like error handling, progress reporting, and efficiency.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
Revised Command with Error Handling:

#find /home/usersdata -user rose -type f -exec cp --parents {} /official \; &> copy_log.txt

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************

This command redirects both standard output and error to a log file named copy_log.txt for later analysis.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Additional Tips:

Use -v option with cp to see detailed output of the copy process.
Consider using xargs with cp for better performance with large numbers of files.
If the issue persists, provide more details about the environment, error messages, and file sizes.
