QUESTION:
After conducting a security audit within the Stratos DC, the Nautilus security team discovered misconfigured permissions on critical files. 
To address this, corrective actions are being taken by the production support team. 
Specifically, the file named /etc/hostname on Nautilus App 1 server requires adjustments to its Access Control Lists (ACLs) as follows:

1. The file's user owner and group owner should be set to root.

2. Others should possess read only permissions on the file.

3. User james must not have any permissions on the file.

4. User jerome should be granted read only permission on the file.

ANSWER:

Prerequisites

SSH access to the Nautilus App 1 server as root or a user with sudo privileges.
Basic understanding of Linux file permissions and ACLs.
e.g.,
#ssh tony@stapp01
password:Ir0nM@n

STEPS AND COMMANDS

1.Check Current Permissions and Ownership
Before making any changes, it's essential to verify the current state of the file.

>CHECK OWNERSHIP
#ls -l /etc/hostname

>CHECK ACLS (IF SUPPORTED BY YOUR SYSTEM)
#getfacl /etc/hostname

2. CHANGE OWNERSHIP TO ROOT

#chown root:root /etc/hostname

3.SET BASIC PERMISSIONS

While not strictly necessary for this task, it's good practice to set basic permissions as well. 
This ensures that the file is accessible to the owner and group.

#chmod 644 /etc/hostname

This sets permissions to read and write for the owner, read only for the group, and read only for others.

4.MODIFY ACLS

To achieve the specific requirements for users james and jerome, we'll use the setfacl command:

>REMOVE ALL ACL ENTRIES FOR THE FILE
#setfacl -b /etc/hostname

>GRANT READ PERMISSION TO OTHERS
#setfacl -m o:r /etc/hostname

>DENY ALL PERMISSIONS FOR USER JAMES
#setfacl -m u:james:--- /etc/hostname

>GRANT READ PERMISSION TO USER JEROME
#setfacl -m u:jerome:r /etc/hostname

EXPLANATION OF COMMANDS:

setfacl -b /etc/hostname: Removes all existing ACL entries from the file.
setfacl -m o:r /etc/hostname: Grants read permission to others (users not explicitly mentioned).
setfacl -m u:james:--- /etc/hostname: Denies all permissions for user james.
setfacl -m u:jerome:r /etc/hostname: Grants read permission to user jerome.

5. Verify Changes

getfacl /etc/hostname

This command will show the updated ACLs for the file.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

ACL Support: Ensure your Linux distribution supports ACLs. If not, you might need to use alternative methods like file ownership and group permissions.
Security Best Practices: While this addresses the specific requirements, consider additional security measures like file integrity monitoring and regular ACL reviews.
Testing: After making changes, it's essential to test the file's accessibility for different users to ensure the desired behavior.
By following these steps and commands, you should successfully configure the ACLs for the /etc/hostname file as required.
