QUESTION:
In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. 
While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 1 within the Stratos Datacenter.

Your task is to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 1. 
Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.


ANSWER:

Granting Execute Permissions to xfusioncorp.sh
Here's how to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 1, allowing all users to execute it:

1.Connect to App Server 1

Use SSH or another remote access tool to connect to App Server 1. You'll need administrative privileges for this task.
e.g.,
#ssh tony@stapp01
password:Ir0nM@n

2.Change directory to /tmp

Use the cd command to navigate to the /tmp directory where the script resides:

#cd /tmp

3.Grant Execute Permissions with chmod

Use the chmod command with the +x option to add the execute permission for all users (owner, group, and others) to the script:

#chmod +x xfusioncorp.sh
or 
#chmod 777 xFusionCorp.sh ...................( If you have to give ALL RWX access to user/file/other )

Explanation:

	chmod: The command used to change file permissions.
	+x: This option adds the execute permission.
	xfusioncorp.sh: The filename you're modifying.
	777:Full access of Read, Write,& Exrcute.
This command will modify the permissions of the script, granting read, write, and execute access for the owner, group, and others.

4.Verify Permissions (Optional)

Use the ls -l command to verify the updated permissions:

#ls -l xfusioncorp.sh

Output Example:

	-rwxrwxrwx 1 user groupname size date xfusioncorp.sh
	-rwxrwxrwx: This indicates the permissions:
	rwx: Read, write, and execute permissions for owner (user)
	rwx: Read, write, and execute permissions for group (groupname)
	rwx: Read, write, and execute permissions for others
	
5.  Execute the Script (Optional)

Now, you can directly execute the script on App Server 1 using its full path:

#/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

=====================================================================================================================================================

Example:
1.ACCESS APPSERVER1
#ssh tony@stapp01
password:Ir0nM@n

2.TO CHECK/VERIFY PERMISSION OF FILES
ls -ld /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

3.TO GIVE FULL PERMISSION TO the /tmp/xfusioncorp file.
chmod 777 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

4.TO CHECK/VERIFY PERMISSION OF FILES
ls -ld /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

5.Execute to scrit
#/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
